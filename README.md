# hello-world

I'm George.  I'm a learning technologist and am interested in most things relating to digital learning.  I'm a coding amateur.  I can bash together prototypes of things, and enjoy working on small projects.  I use Javascript, HTML, CSS, BBC Basic ;) and have started playing around with PHP and node.js.


I'm very intersted in chatbots, xAPI, Raspberry PI, and all things Open.


This is my "Hello World" repository, so I can get my head around how Github works.
